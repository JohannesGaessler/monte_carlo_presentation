Monte Carlo (MC) methods are an important tool for multi-dimensional integration
and they find application in many fields, including particle physics.
However, as the computations associated with them can be very expensive parallelization is essential.
The most straightforward option is to simply run them on several CPU cores in parallel.
Another option is to use hardware accelerators such as GPUs to speed up the calculation.

This paper introduces a few fundamental MC techniques and algorithms,
explains the hardware and thread model of GPUs,
lists a few programming patterns can be used for efficient parallelization,
and finally shows a simple benchmark of MC when run on either a CPU or GPU.
